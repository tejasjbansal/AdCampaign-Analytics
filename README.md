# AdCampaign-Analytics

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Data Engineering Project! In this project, we aim to help a client or company understand key aspects of running an online ad campaign on YouTube. Our primary goals are to categorize videos based on comments and stylistics, and to identify factors affecting the popularity of YouTube videos. By doing this, the client can make informed decisions before investing in their YouTube campaign.

### Project Objectives
1. **Categorize YouTube Videos**: Analyze comments and stylistic features.
2. **Identify Popularity Factors**: Determine what affects a videoâ€™s popularity.
3. **Scalability**: Ensure the data pipeline is scalable for large datasets.
4. **Visualization**: Create a dashboard for easy data visualization and understanding.

## Tools and Technologies

We will use several AWS services to build our data pipeline and achieve our project objectives:

1. **Amazon S3**: Build and manage a data lake.
2. **AWS Glue**: Cataloging and ETL jobs.
3. **AWS Spark**: Data processing and transformations.
4. **Amazon Athena**: Querying and analyzing data.
5. **Amazon SNS**: Notifications.
6. **AWS IAM**: Security and access management.
7. **Dashboard Tools**: For data visualization.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Ingestion
- **Sources**: Data will come from multiple sources, including structured data (e.g., CSV files) and semi-structured data (e.g., JSON files).
- **Incremental Ingestion**: Scripts to ingest data incrementally.

### 2. Data Lake Design
- **Amazon S3**: Store and organize data.
- **Partitioning**: Properly partition different tables to optimize performance.
- **Data Lake vs. Data Warehouse**: Understand the differences and when to use each.

### 3. Data Cataloging
- **AWS Glue**: Catalog the data in the data lake.
- **Schema Management**: Build and manage schemas for the data.

### 4. ETL Pipeline
- **AWS Glue and Spark**: Write ETL jobs to extract, transform, and load data.
- **Transformation**: Clean and transform data to make it suitable for analysis.

### 5. Data Analysis
- **Amazon Athena**: Write SQL queries to analyze and understand the data.

### 6. Dashboard Creation
- **Visualization**: Build a dashboard to visualize the data and insights.
- **Decision Making**: Enable the business to make data-driven decisions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **AWS Account**: Ensure you have an AWS account with necessary permissions.
- **Basic Knowledge**: Familiarity with AWS services, big data concepts, and SQL.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Create S3 Buckets**: Set up S3 buckets for storing raw and processed data.
2. **Set Up AWS Glue**: Configure AWS Glue for data cataloging and ETL jobs.
3. **Configure IAM Roles**: Set up IAM roles and policies for accessing AWS services.
4. **Data Ingestion Scripts**: Write and run scripts to ingest data into S3.
5. **ETL Jobs**: Develop and deploy ETL jobs using AWS Glue and Spark.
6. **Query Data with Athena**: Use Athena to run SQL queries on the data.
7. **Build Dashboard**: Use tools like Amazon QuickSight or other visualization tools to create the dashboard.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Big Data
Big data refers to massive datasets with varied and complex structures, including structured data (e.g., CSV files) and unstructured data (e.g., audio, video, images). As data size grows, challenges include storing, analyzing, and visualizing the data effectively.

### Data Lake
A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. It helps in organizing and managing large datasets efficiently.

### ETL Pipeline
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a process that involves extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a suitable format, and loading it into a final destination for analysis.

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, you will have a comprehensive understanding of building a scalable data pipeline using AWS services, from data ingestion to visualization. This will enable the client to make informed decisions for their YouTube ad campaign.

Happy coding and data engineering!
